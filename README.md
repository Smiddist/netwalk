# netwalk

Solver for netwalk, possibly also reading in image files of game state [under development]

- terminology for components etc. as in [De Biasi 2012][debiasi12]

![Schematic of the NetWalk puzzle and its components, from De Biasi (2012) The complexity of the puzzle game Net: rotating wires can drive you crazy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmmx/shots/master/2018/Feb/de-biasi12_figs1-%2B-2_netwalk-schematic.png)

## TODO

- write tests for components (will function as a final check of workings out)
  - I think the classes are all implemented correctly now
