# netwalk

Solver for netwalk, possibly also reading in image files of game state [under development]

- terminology for components etc. as in [De Biasi 2012][debiasi12]

[debiasi12]: http://www.nearly42.org/vdisk/cstheory/netnpc.pdf "The complexity of the puzzle game Net: rotating wires can drive you crazy"

## TODO

- write tests for components (will function as a final check of workings out)
  - I think the classes are all implemented correctly now
